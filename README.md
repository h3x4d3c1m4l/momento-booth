    * Webcam support doesn't work properly
    * Libgphoto2 is not bundled correctly yet
* User manual

### Maybe

* Direct printing support (using libusb) to fully control printing queue
  * Focus would be on Canon CP1300, Canon CP1500

## Development

### Stack

* Languages: [Dart](https://dart.dev/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), C++ (Windows, Linux), Swift (macOS)
  * Dart/Rust glue: [flutter_rust_bridge](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rust_bridge)
* UI: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
  * UI kit: [fluent_ui](https://pub.dev/packages/fluent_ui)
  * Routing: [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)
* Webcam: [Nokhwa](https://crates.io/crates/nokhwa)
* Printing: [Printing](https://pub.dev/packages/printing)
* Logging: [Loggy](https://pub.dev/packages/loggy)
* Data classes: [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)
* Firefox Send client: [ffsend-api](https://crates.io/crates/ffsend-api)
* JPEG decoding: [zune-jpeg](https://crates.io/crates/zune-jpeg), encoding: [jpeg-encoder](https://crates.io/crates/jpeg-encoder)

### Requirements

On Windows:

* Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
  * Optional: A full Visual Studio 2022 install
  * Make sure to select "Desktop development with C++" on the Workloads tab when installing
* Rust (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` target)
  * Install using `rustup` is recommended, to keep all components up to date

On macOS:

* Xcode
  * Install using App Store is recommended, to keep it up to date
* Rust (`aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` targets)
  * Install using `rustup` is recommended, to keep all components up to date

On Linux:

* [This list](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#additional-linux-requirements) of packages from the Flutter website
  * The install command provided by the Flutter website may only work on Ubuntu, please check your distro website for the corresponding package names
* Additional packages: llvm, libssl-dev
* Rust (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` target)
  * Install using `rustup` is recommended, to keep all components up to date

All platforms:

* `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
  * Install using Cargo: `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
* Flutter SDK 3.10.0+
  * Be sure that the `flutter` command is available globally as `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` needs it\
    This is especially important when using Flutter SDK managers like `asdf` or `fvm`
* Optional: For building the documentation mdBook and some extensions for mdBook are needed
  * Install using Cargo: `cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid mdbook-admonish`

For all tools, we support the latest versions.

### Getting Started

### Build steps

### Using `rps` (recommended)

Please note: This method expects global fvm and Dart installs to be available.

1. Install `rps` using `dart pub global activate rps`
2. Run `rps` from the root folder of the repository

### Manually

Please note: Run all commands from the root folder of the repository, unless mentioned otherwise.

1. Run `flutter gen-l10n`
2. Run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`:
    * Windows/Linux: `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input rust/src/dart_bridge/api.rs --dart-output lib/rust_bridge/library_api.generated.dart --rust-output rust/src/dart_bridge/ffi_exports.rs --skip-add-mod-to-lib --no-build-runner`
    * macOS: `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --rust-input rust/src/dart_bridge/api.rs --dart-output lib/rust_bridge/library_api.generated.dart --rust-output rust/src/dart_bridge/ffi_exports.rs --c-output macos/Runner/bridge_generated.h --skip-add-mod-to-lib --no-build-runner`
    * Note: Make sure to re-run this command if you changed anything in the Rust subproject
3. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
    * Note: During development, it may be convenient to run `watch` instead of `build` to keep the script running to process any new or changes files
4. Run `flutter run` or use your IDE to run the application
    * Note: This will automatically build the Rust subproject before building the Flutter project, so no need to worry about that!

### Adding a new screen using the VS Code extension Template

1. Make sure to have the [Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yongwoo.template) extension installed
2. Right click the `views` folder in VS Code Explorer
3. Click _Template: Create New (with rename)_, pick the `view` template
4. Pick a name, enter it in `{snake_case}_screen` format (e.g. `settings_screen` or `email_photo_screen`), press Enter
5. Your new view should be available!
